# Pixalia #
Pixalia is a free, open source massively multiplayer online (FOSMMO, thought it's actually not massive) game and thought experiment. It's based around the idea that people often don't realize how quickly they are judged, and included (or excluded) based on appearance. Admittedly, this was somewhat of an after-thought, and the game is mostly just a learning experience. This is the server for the game, the client is [available on  GitHub](https://www.github.com/aaronweiss74/pixalia).

### Requirements ###
* Maven, as a build system.
* Netty, for networking.
* Guava, for utilities.  
* slf4j, for logging.  
n.b. Maven is nice enough to actually handle all of the dependencies.

### Acknowledgements ###
* [Aravind Koneru](aravindkoneru), for listening to incessant ranting about how "I'm going to finish networking soon."
* [Pavan Hegde](pavanh91), for hopefully using this to learn how to use Netty.
* [rice](https://www.github.com/wahlao), for the name, and some inspiration.
